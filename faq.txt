Django Rest Framework (DRF) :
1.Django is web framework in python to develop a web application in python.
Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern.
MTV is useful because it completely separates server code from the clientâ€™s machine

2.Django follows MVC (model-view-controller) architecture pattern, written in Python programming language designed for creating easy and rapid development. 
Django contains four layers:
- Models Layer that describes the database schema and data structure.
- Views Layer is UI responsible for controlling what a user sees, retrieving data from appropriate models and executing any calculation made to the data. It finally sends executed data to the template.
- Templates Layer is responsible for determining how a user sees. Also, it is responsible for describing how the data is received from the views. Should the data received be changed or formatted for display on the web page?
- Controller Layer controls the requests and responses, set-up database connections and loading add-ons. It also specifies the Django framework and URL parsing.

3.In Django, middleware is a lightweight plugin that processes during request and response execution.
Middleware is used to perform a function in the application.
The functions can be a security, session, csrf protection, authentication etc.

4.Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), which enables you to interact with your database, like you would with SQL. In fact, Django's ORM is just a pythonical way to create SQL to query and manipulate your database and get results in a pythonic fashion.

5.A session is a mechanism to store information on the server side during the interaction with the web application.
In Django, by default session stores in the database and also allows file-based and cache based sessions. It is implemented via a piece of middleware and can be enabled by using the following code.
